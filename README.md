### We implemented the computer opponent algorithm.
The game is a well-known board game invented in 1880. The game board is an 6 by 6 matrix, But the user can enlarge it to 8x8 / 10x10 / 12x12. The board can contain black and white painted coins (a different color on each side of the coin). Each player has the color Its representative (as in checkers). Each user, in his turn, adds a coin to the board in such a way that it blocks a sequence Coins of the other player so it's blocked from the other side. Then the blocked coins Turn over to his color. The winner is the one who has more coins of his color on the board.
